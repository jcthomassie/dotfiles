# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles and configs for MacOS, AL2, and WSL.

Bootstrap by running:

```shell
curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcthomassie/dotfiles/HEAD/install.sh | sh
```

After installation on MacOS, set the iTerm2 profile location:

- Navigate to **General > Preferences**
- Enable **Load preferences from a custom folder or URL**
- Enter `~/dotfiles/.iterm2_profile`
